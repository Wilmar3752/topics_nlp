The sensors allow the delivery of real-time information on a range of production systems, making each day relevant to the development of autonomous agricultural machinery. The sensors implementation in sugarcane operations is no exception. The objective of this work was to present the technological evolution and the state of the art of the sensors used in the monitoring, decision-making and management process for sugarcane cultivation. This review addresses the sensors involved in the agricultural operations of sugarcane production. For soil preparation and properties, the sensors involved in the diagnosis of compacted areas, depth of the soil preparation tool and monitoring the traction force. In planting, the monitored variable is the sugarcane stalks mass flow poured into the planting furrows. Optical remote sensing, vegetative index, ultrasonic, photoelectric and cameras are tools that help in the task of monitoring sugarcane cultivation. One of the significant challenges for fertilization is to quantify the soil need for nutrient replacement. In spraying, the implementation of sensors to detect pests or weeds. At harvest, the sensors used real-time yield estimation and the sensors for base cut height controlling. Finally, it was found that the integration of sensors of different physical principles to measure crop and soil attributes. Machine operational variables are a trend together with the use of intelligent control systems. This trend generates an increase in the volume of data on the crop, improving the management of the fleet and inputs,and demanding a robust data network in the field.The sensors allow the delivery of real-time information on a range of production systems, making each day relevant to the development of autonomous agricultural machinery.
