that generate electricity from sugarcane bagasse have limited use of sugarcane trash (SCT) of up to 10% due to some technical problems, mainly associated with sintering, deposits, incrustations and corrosion, reducing the efficiency, and increasing maintenance and energy production costs. This publication is a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art knowledge in this field to identify actual trends, experiences, and the most effective treatments to reduce these drawbacks. Here, we review the most used pretreatment methods, classified into physical, chemical, biological, and multiple or combinatorial pretreatments. Our main findings are that the best option for handling SCT is to leave ca. 50% on the field and take the other 50% to the factory together with the cane, where a dry cane cleaning system is installed, and that among the most effective dry cleaning designs for SCT separation are vibratory roller systems and pneumatic cleaning. Additionally, SCT needs to be mixed with bagasse before firing. Biological pretreatments employ microorganisms that degrade lignin and hemicellulose, and their use is outside the context of thermochemical conversion of SCT.that generate electricity from sugarcane bagasse have limited use of sugarcane trash (SCT) of up to 10% due to some technical problems, mainly associated with sintering, deposits, incrustations and corrosion, reducing the efficiency, and increasing maintenance and energy production costs.
